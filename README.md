# DDOS
DDOS detection using traditional ML algorithms 
Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are a major threat to the availability of online services. Traditional DDoS detection methods are often ineffective against sophisticated attacks. Machine learning algorithms offer a promising approach to DDoS detection, as they can learn to identify patterns in network traffic that are indicative of an attack.

This project will evaluate the effectiveness of traditional machine learning algorithms for DDoS detection. The project will focus on the following algorithms:

K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
Support vector machines (SVM)
Random forests
Naive Bayes
Decision tree
The algorithms will be evaluated using the CICDDOS2019 dataset. Further, we'll be using Exploratory Data Analysis and normalization to evaluate the performance of theseÂ algorithms.
